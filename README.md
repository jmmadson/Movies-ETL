# Movies ETL

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to take data from various locations including: 
* Wikipedia JSON
* Kaggle Metadata CSV
* Ratings CSV

We were tasked with reviewing, cleaning & joining the data into a usable dataframe for a hackathon. After we had a clean, usable dataframe we exported it to a SQL database for easy use.
